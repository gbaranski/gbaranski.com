# Projects

## Houseflow

Home automation platform, the project in which I put the most effort. Started it at the very beginning of the programming journey. This project involves a lot of different topics, like networking, electronics, mobile and web development, databases, devops, etc.

## LightMQ

Lightweight client-server messaging protocol. Intented to work for [Houseflow](#houseflow), as a replacement to MQTT which turned out to be too complicated.

## Cryptogram
