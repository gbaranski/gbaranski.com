## Houseflow

Home automation platform, the project in which I put the most effort. Started it at the very beginning of the programming journey. This project involves a lot of different topics, like networking, electronics, mobile and web development, databases, devops, etc.

Made using 
- Rust for high performance networking services with low memory footprint.
- Go for OAuth2 Server implementation for Google Smart Home Actions.
- C for Embedded devices, including ESP8266

Previously also
- Typescript for Web application and backend
- React for Web application
- Flutter for mobile application
