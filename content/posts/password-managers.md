# Introduction
I was looking for password manager for quite long time which will meet all following requirements
1. Open-source
2. CLI/TUI application, mustn't be written in any scripting languauge, I don't want high startup time, I might use password manager in scripts and 0.5s startup time bottleneck is not a way to go.
3. Android & Linux support
4. Option for self-hosting
5. Must be relatively easy to synchronize between multiple computers, must work on Linux and Android.

## What I've tried so far

### Bitwarden

1. ✅ Open-source, under GNU GPLv2 License.
2. ❌ There is CLI app, but it's written in JS which makes it horribly slow to stat up, launching `bw --help` took 544ms, it's a lot, just for comparsion [gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) help page takes 66ms, retrieving specific password takes 200ms, huge difference.
3. ✅ Android & Linux is fully supported, desktop app is written in Electron, which is slow and enabling Wayland's fractional scaling makes everything blurred.
4. ✅ Yes, via [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden).
5. ✅ Super simple to synchronize, probably easiest from all options I've mentioned here.

### KeepassXC

1. ✅ Open-source, under GNU GPLv3 License.
2. ✅ There is `keepassxc-cli`.
3. ✅ Android is supported by [KeepassDX](https://www.keepassdx.com/), I personally don't like the UI of app, Linux is supported
4. ✅ Self-host by storing database on computer.
5. ❌ Complicated synchronization between Linux and Android.

### gopass

1. ✅ Open-source, under MIT License.
2. ✅ gopass by itself is CLI/TUI Application.
3. ✅ Android is supported by [Android-Password-Store](https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store), application is very nice, looks best from all mobile applications mentioned here, Linux is supported.
4. ✅ Self-host by storing Git repo on computer.
5. ✅ As soon as you get GPG keys working, it's super easy by pushing it to Github 

### Verdict

As you can see, gopass meets all of my requirements.

This post is going to cover
- GPG Keys for safe encrypting/decrypting stored keys.
- Git repository to store passwords.
- Synchronizing passwords between Android and Linux.
- Setting up gopass password store.

# Prerequisites

`GPG_TTY` variable must be set to get GPG working, check if exists by `echo $GPG_TTY`, if it's not set `GPG_TTY` to output of `tty` command.

Bash/ZSH: 
```bash
# ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
```

Fish:
```bash
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish
export GPG_TTY=(tty)
```

# Git repository

We need Git repository to store passwords, I store them in Github private repository, although it could be even self-hosted. Keep in mind that password database don't need to be super secure, of course it will be better if it will be, but the password database encrypted with password you'll use in GnuPG.

Create Github repository using [Github CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli/)
```bash
$ gh repo create pass
? Visibility Private
? This will create the "pass" repository on GitHub. Continue? Yes
✓ Created repository gbaranski/pass on GitHub
? Create a local project directory for "gbaranski/pass"? No
```

# GPG keys

## GPG Primary key

***If you already have GPG Primary Key that you can use, you can skip this step***
   
Generate new GPG Key using `gpg --full-generate-key --expert`, we're using RSA because I'm not sure about ECC keys compatibility.

The primary key won't be able to encrypt/sign, since we'll have sub-keys for that, primary key will be used only to create new sub-keys.

```none
$ gpg --full-generate-key --expert

RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (3072) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Grzegorz Baranski
Email address: root@gbaranski.com
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Grzegorz Baranski <root@gbaranski.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
gpg: key 2B0DFED5C9433443 marked as ultimately trusted
gpg: directory '/home/gbaranski/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d' created

uid                      Grzegorz Baranski <root@gbaranski.com>
```

In this example root@gbaranski.com will used as GPG Key ID identifier, of course replace it with your own email when setting it up, but if you have few GPG Key IDs with the same email, check your GPG Key ID by using `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format 0xLONG` and then use it instead email.

Check if the keypair has been properly created
```none
$ gpg --list-secret-key --keyid-format 0xLONG root@gbaranski.com
sec   rsa4096/0x2B0DFED5C9433443 2021-05-17 [C]

ssb   rsa4096/0x1EF8CFF39BDF9EB4 2021-05-17 [E]
```

### Backing up primary secret key

Copy `~/.gnupg` to some safe place, such as USB Stick. In my example it will be at `/media/usb/gnupg`, if mounting it there is not possible, you can use soft links to accomplish this.

Remove key from computer since it's safely stored
```bash
$ gpg --delete-key root@gbaranski.com
```

## GPG Sub Key

The only usage of GPG Sub Key will be encoding, so disallow "Sign" which is allowed by default.

Generate new GPG Sub Key
```none
$ gpg --homedir /media/usb/gnupg --expert --edit-key root@gbaranski.com

### Veryfing generated sub-key

#### Check whether sub-key exists in keys list

```none
$ gpg --homedir /media/usb/gnupg --expert --list-keys --keyid-format 0xLONG
/media/usb/gnupg/pubring.kbx
----------------------------
pub   rsa4096/0x2B0DFED5C9433443 2021-05-17 [C]
      226CDFD0B2C81A32E2C3DBEF2B0DFED5C9433443
uid                   [ultimate] Grzegorz Baranski <root@gbaranski.com>
sub   rsa4096/0x1EF8CFF39BDF9EB4 2021-05-17 [E]
```

Sub-key has been created with Key ID `0x1EF8CFF39BDF9EB4`, copy this ID, we will need it in the next step

##### Check if encrypting/decrypting works properly

```none
$ echo "hello there!" | gpg --homedir /media/usb/gnupg --recipient root@gbaranski.com --encrypt | gpg --homedir /media/usb/gnupg --decrypt
gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID 1EF8CFF39BDF9EB4, created 2021-05-17
      "Grzegorz Baranski <root@gbaranski.com>"
hello there!
```

### Exporting from store

```bash
$ gpg --homedir /media/usb/gnupg --output /tmp/gpg-subkey --export-secret-subkeys root@gbaranski.com! SUB_KEY_ID!
$ gpg --homedir /media/usb/gnupg --export-ownertrust > /tmp/gpg-ownertrust
```

**Replace SUB_KEY_ID with ID copied from previous step, dont forget exclamation mark**

*Example with `0x1EF8CFF39BDF9EB4` as SUB_KEY_ID*
```bash
$ gpg --homedir /media/usb/gnupg --output /tmp/gpg-subkey --export-secret-subkeys root@gbaranski.com! 0x1EF8CFF39BDF9EB4!
```

### Importing on the same PC

```bash
$ gpg --import /tmp/gpg-subkey
$ gpg --import-ownertrust /tmp/gpg-ownertrust
$ rm /tmp/gpg-subkey
```

Verify that `gpg -K` shows `sec#` instead of just `sec` for primary key.
```bash
$ gpg -K
/home/gbaranski/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
----------------------------------
sec#  rsa4096 2021-05-17 [C]
      226CDFD0B2C81A32E2C3DBEF2B0DFED5C9433443

### Importing on remote PC

Use some file-transfer program e.g [`croc`](https://github.com/schollz/croc).

Send keys from PC-A to PC-B

On PC-A
```none
$ croc send /tmp/gpg-subkey /tmp/gpg-ownertrust
Sending 2 files (3.7 kB)
Code is: 0560-mile-mercury-deliver
On the other computer run

croc 0560-mile-mercury-deliver

gpg-ownertrust 100% |████████████████████| (167/167 B, 245.872 kB/s) 2/2
```

On PC-B
```none
$ croc --out /tmp 0560-mile-mercury-deliver

Accept 2 files (3.7 kB)? (y/n) y

#### Importing on Android

Send keys to Android using [`croc`](https://github.com/schollz/croc)
```none
$ croc send /tmp/gpg-subkey
Sending 'gpg-subkey' (3.5 kB)
Code is: 3343-system-book-sinatra

croc 3343-system-book-sinatra

Sending (->192.168.1.214:37712)
 100% |████████████████████| (3.5/3.5 kB, 4.728 MB/s)
```

Receive them on Android using [Croc Android](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.howeyc.crocgui/)

To import PGP Key on Android, use OpenKeychain app, available in [`F-Droid`](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.sufficientlysecure.keychain/).
Import gpg-subkey by selecting  and then "Import from File".

Open [Android-Password-Store](https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store), clone repository from Github and view your passwords.

# Conclusions

gopass is awesome password manager for people who like using things in terminal, for me setting up GPG keys correctly was the hardest thing.

I hope this article was useful and saved you some time. 👋
